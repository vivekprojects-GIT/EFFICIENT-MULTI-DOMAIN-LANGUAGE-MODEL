      "question": "What is the difference between civil law and criminal law?",
      "answer": "Civil law and criminal law are two distinct branches of the legal system. Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, typically involving issues like contracts, property, family matters, and personal injury. The goal is to resolve disputes and provide compensation. Criminal law, on the other hand, deals with offenses against society as a whole, such as theft, assault, or murder. The goal is to punish wrongdoers and protect society. Civil cases are usually decided by a preponderance of evidence, while criminal cases require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.",

      "question": "What is the statute of limitations?",
      "answer": "A statute of limitations is a law that sets the maximum time period during which legal proceedings may be initiated after an alleged offense or injury occurs. The time limits vary depending on the type of case and jurisdiction. For example, personal injury cases might have a 2-3 year limit, while contract disputes might have a 4-6 year limit. The purpose is to ensure that legal actions are brought while evidence is still fresh and witnesses are available. Once the statute of limitations expires, the right to bring a lawsuit is typically lost forever.",

      "question": "What constitutes a valid contract?",
      "answer": "A valid contract requires several essential elements: offer (one party proposes terms), acceptance (other party agrees to the terms), consideration (something of value exchanged), mutual assent (both parties understand and agree), capacity (both parties are legally competent), and legality (the contract's purpose must be legal). The contract must also be in writing for certain types of agreements, such as real estate transactions or contracts that cannot be performed within one year. Without these elements, a contract may be unenforceable or void.",

      "question": "What is the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony?",
      "answer": "Misdemeanors and felonies are two categories of criminal offenses based on their severity. Misdemeanors are less serious crimes typically punishable by fines, community service, probation, or imprisonment for less than one year. Examples include petty theft, simple assault, or traffic violations. Felonies are more serious crimes punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, often in state or federal prison. Examples include murder, rape, armed robbery, or large-scale fraud. The distinction varies by jurisdiction, and some states have additional categories like gross misdemeanors.",

      "question": "What is the burden of proof in a civil case?",
      "answer": "In civil cases, the burden of proof is typically 'preponderance of the evidence,' which means that the plaintiff must show that it is more likely than not (greater than 50% probability) that their version of events is true. This is a lower standard than the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard used in criminal cases. The plaintiff has the initial burden of proof to establish their case, but the burden may shift to the defendant if they raise certain defenses. The burden of proof helps ensure that the party making the claim must provide sufficient evidence to support their position.",

      "question": "What is the Miranda warning?",
      "answer": "The Miranda warning is a constitutional requirement that police must inform suspects of their rights before conducting custodial interrogations. The warning includes: the right to remain silent, that anything said can be used against them in court, the right to an attorney, and that an attorney will be provided if they cannot afford one. This stems from the 1966 Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona. If police fail to give the Miranda warning before questioning a suspect in custody, any statements made may be inadmissible in court, though the case can still proceed with other evidence.",

      "question": "What is intellectual property law?",
      "answer": "Intellectual property law protects creations of the mind, including inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. It encompasses several areas: patents (protect inventions and processes), copyrights (protect original works of authorship like books, music, software), trademarks (protect brand names, logos, slogans), and trade secrets (protect confidential business information). The purpose is to encourage innovation and creativity by giving creators exclusive rights to their work for a limited time, while balancing the public's interest in access to knowledge and cultural works.",

      "question": "What is the difference between mediation and arbitration?",
      "answer": "Mediation and arbitration are both alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods, but they differ significantly. Mediation is a voluntary, non-binding process where a neutral third party (mediator) helps the parties reach a mutually acceptable solution. The mediator facilitates communication but doesn't make decisions. Arbitration, on the other hand, is a more formal process where a neutral third party (arbitrator) hears evidence and makes a binding decision. Arbitration can be binding or non-binding, and the arbitrator's decision is usually final and enforceable in court, similar to a court judgment.",

      "question": "What is the Fourth Amendment and what does it protect?",
      "answer": "The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government. It requires that searches and seizures be based on probable cause and authorized by a warrant issued by a judge. However, there are many exceptions to the warrant requirement, such as searches incident to arrest, plain view doctrine, consent searches, and exigent circumstances. The amendment also requires that warrants must be specific about the place to be searched and the items to be seized. Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment may be excluded from court proceedings under the exclusionary rule.",

      "question": "What is the difference between a will and a trust?",
      "answer": "A will and a trust are both estate planning tools, but they serve different purposes. A will is a legal document that specifies how a person's assets should be distributed after their death and who should care for minor children. It only takes effect after death and must go through probate court. A trust is a legal arrangement where one person (trustee) holds and manages assets for the benefit of another (beneficiary). Trusts can be revocable or irrevocable, can take effect during life or after death, and generally avoid probate. Trusts offer more privacy, flexibility, and control over asset distribution compared to wills.",
