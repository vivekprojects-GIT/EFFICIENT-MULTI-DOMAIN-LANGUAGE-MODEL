      "question": "What is the definition of sleep and how does it differ from other states of consciousness?",
      "answer": "Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity, during which consciousness is altered and certain sensory activity is inhibited. This is different from other states of consciousness, such as wakefulness, coma, or disorders of consciousness, because sleep still involves active brain patterns and the ability to react to stimuli, albeit to a lesser extent. Sleep is characterized by repeating periods of REM and non-REM sleep, and it serves important functions for overall health and well-being.",

      "question": "What is the difference between a virus and bacteria?",
      "answer": "Viruses and bacteria are both microorganisms, but they differ significantly. Bacteria are single-celled organisms that can live independently and reproduce on their own. They can be beneficial (like those in our gut) or harmful (causing infections). Viruses, on the other hand, are much smaller and cannot reproduce on their own - they need to infect a host cell to replicate. Viruses are generally always harmful, while bacteria can be either helpful or harmful to humans.",

      "answer": "The recommended daily water intake varies by individual, but general guidelines suggest about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) for men and 2.7 liters (91 ounces) for women per day. This includes water from all sources - beverages and food. However, individual needs depend on factors like age, activity level, climate, health status, and whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding.

      "answer": "The common cold and flu are both respiratory illnesses caused by different viruses. Colds are usually milder with symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and sore throat, and symptoms develop gradually. The flu is typically more severe with symptoms including fever, body aches, fatigue, and weakness, and symptoms often come on suddenly. Flu can lead to serious complications like pneumonia, while colds rarely do. Both are contagious but flu tends to be more severe and potentially dangerous.",

      "answer": "Normal blood pressure is typically defined as less than 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure is measured in two numbers: systolic (top number, pressure when heart beats) and diastolic (bottom number, pressure when heart rests between beats). Categories include: Normal (less than 120/80), Elevated (120-129/less than 80), Stage 1 Hypertension (130-139/80-89), and Stage 2 Hypertension (140/90 or higher).
