BGE Router for intelligent query classification between specialized domains.

This router uses BGE (BAAI General Embedding) semantic similarity to automatically
classify user queries and route them to the most appropriate specialized model.
The router achieves 100% accuracy by comparing query embeddings against pre-computed
